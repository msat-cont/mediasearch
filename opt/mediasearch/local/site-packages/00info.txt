Copy or link here the outer python libraries that are necessary
to run a Flask application and to work with MongoDB, i.e.

flask, flask_pymongo, werkzeug, pymongo, ...

The action may be (depending on the running system) something like:

> apt-get install python-dev mongodb-server
>
> pip install pymongo
> pip install Flask
> pip install flask_pymongo
